problem with understanding loss function and optimizing function

try to increase the acc by increasing the epoch
acc increase from 70 to 82 by increasing the epoch 10 to 50

change the sequential from ReLU to sigmoid
acc decrease

change the parameter from 512 to 256
acc decrease

change the hidder layer from 2 to 10
acc only 10% left. what a disaster
the Vanishing gradient problem 

I still need to study some theory to understand more detail of the code
